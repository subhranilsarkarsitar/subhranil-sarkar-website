                  The Etawah gharana is a North Indian school of sitar and surbahar
                  music and named after a small town close to Agra where Imdad Khan
                  (1848â€“1920) lived. It is also known as Imdadkhani gharana in the
                  honour of its founder, Imdad Khan.
                </p>
                <p className="gharana-details">
                  The gharana's achievements include the development of the Surbahar,
                  major structural changes to both the sitar and surbahar, and the
                  creation of the instrumental style known as the gayaki ang (vocal
                  style performed on sitar) by Vilayat Khan. This style of sitar is now
                  known as the Vilayatkhani sitar.
